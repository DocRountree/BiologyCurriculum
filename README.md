## Unit 1: Physical Chemistry of Life

### Big Idea:

Particles form atoms, which form molecules, which form life, according to simple rules for the sharing of electrons.

#### Lesson 2: Atomic Structure
#### Lesson 3: Periodic Table of Elements
### Chapter 2: Bonding and Molecules
#### Lesson 1: Ions and Bonds
#### Lesson 2: Compounds and Molecules
#### Lesson 3: Solutions and Polarity
#### Chapter 3: Organic Chemistry

### Chapter 5: Origins of Life
#### Lesson 1: Autocatalytic Sets
#### Lesson 2: Self-Assembly
#### Lesson 3: Proto-Cells

## Unit 2: Evolution by Natural Selection

### Big Idea:

Any population of self replicating systems (replicators) in which the fitness of the child replicant differs from the parent replicator will inevitably result in adaptive change over successive generations.

## Unit 3: Unity of Life

### Big Idea:

All life inherits the self-replicating DNA/RNA/Protein encoding system inside cells bound by permeable membranes.

#### Lesson 2: Enzymes and Metabolism
#### Lesson 3: Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis

## Unit 4: Diversity of Life

### Big Idea:

Different adaptations can be equally effective, leading one population to become two, the process by which a single celled ancestor diversified repeatedly into all the life on Earth today.

### Chapter 1: Cladistics 
#### Lesson 1: Lineages and Ancestry
#### Lesson 2: Speciation
#### Lesson 3: Clades
### Chapter 2: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes

### Chapter 5: Protostomes 
#### Lesson 1: Unity of Protostomes
#### Lesson 2: Spiralia
#### Lesson 3: Chelicerata, Myriopoda, and Relatives
#### Lesson 4: Odonata, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera 
### Chapter 6: Deuterostomes
